=========================

During a "staycation" , Microsoft who unfortunately spent more then our current missile defense system in finally trying to end "My Computer Zone" XSS zone vulnerabilities,  I sat down and see if this could be broken after all of their efforts.  I immediately notified secure@microsoft.com ethically and was sent plane ticket to work with the Internet Explorer team.  There are now options such as "lock security settings" and kill-bits as well as automatic updates that were a direct effect of my staycation and a nomination in the Microsoft MVP program.
